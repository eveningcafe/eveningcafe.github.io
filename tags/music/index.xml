English
I met that nostalgic person in a crowd
The smiling face bites a little
It’s the same as it used to be It’s a hurt love, but there ’s no trace anymore.
If you happen to meet me, you will start crying
I was thinking If you look at the show window sideways
I think of the time when I met Now to the place where different lovers wait</description></item><item><title>Where does the loneliness go - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/where-does-the-loneliness-go-yumi-arai-/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 18:19:53 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/where-does-the-loneliness-go-yumi-arai-/</guid><description>ENGLISH
You live in a country at the ends of the earth.
Did you only come back
Because you missed the peaceful winter scenery here?
Did you only call me out of the blue, and tell me we should meet up
To ask what had happened to all your old friends, too? I might act tough, but only I know
You left on a journey then
We embraced each other’s loneliness</description></item><item><title>Message in Rouge - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/song-message-in-rouge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:41:53 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/song-message-in-rouge/</guid><description>ルージュの伝言
The song’s lyrics show a girl’s actions after finding out that her boyfriend cheated. What’s surprising is the fact that this girl is off on a journey to tell her boyfriend’s mother about the incident! (Yuming is the only one that can make these lyrics work.)

I’m on a train by myself right now
To meet his momma
In the corner of my eye as twilight draws near,</description></item></channel></rss>
