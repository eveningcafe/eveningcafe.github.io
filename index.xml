The white slope continued on to the sky
Wavering, ephemerality envelops her
Unnoticed by anyone, all alone,
She is ascending
She fears nothing, and soars up high
She admires the sky, is dashing through the sky
Vapor trails are her life
At that high window, even before her death,
She looked to the sky, and now they don’t understand
Other people don’t understand
They only think that
She was too young, but she is happy</description></item><item><title>Wish I Could Back to That Day - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/wish-i-could-back-to-that-day-yumi-arai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 09:47:11 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/wish-i-could-back-to-that-day-yumi-arai/</guid><description>あの日にかえりたい
ENGLISH
I piece together the photo I tore up
In tears in the palm of my hand
Seeing myself smiling yesterday, worry-free
Hurts for reasons I can’t explain
We all forget what our adolescence looks like
As it walks away from us
Wish I could go back to who I used to be then
And see you
My memories wander through the sky
As twilight begins to fall in the city</description></item><item><title>Chinese soup - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/chinese-soup-yumi-arai/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/chinese-soup-yumi-arai/</guid><description>ENGLISH
I sit down in a chair and use my nails
To string some pea pods
If the pods were my heart,
The peas would be men I’ve broken up with
They all spill into the bottom of a pot
They lose their shape when I simmer them down
It’s almost done
I made it for you Chinese soup
Tonight’s soup is Chinese soup
What if when you came home late</description></item><item><title>Sun shower - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/sun-shower-yumi-arai/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/sun-shower-yumi-arai/</guid><description>天気雨
English
Walking along the edge of the waves, you try not to get wet
It’s as if you were carefully dodge my love.
If I walk in front of you while stepping on a tight zipper heel
You’ll see my bare feet and perhaps feel a little something
From between the low-lying clouds, a sun shower
The horizon is hazy with smoke
You told me you were going to Goddess to fix your surfboard</description></item><item><title>When tenderness embraces me - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/when-tenderness-embraces-me-yumi-arai/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/when-tenderness-embraces-me-yumi-arai/</guid><description>やさしさに包まれたなら
English
When I was small, God was there
to mysteriously make my dreams come true.
On mornings when I&amp;rsquo;m woken by gentle feelings,
miracles happen, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve become an adult.
Opening the curtains, the quiet sunlight that filters through the trees
When tenderness embraces me, then surely
everything reflected to my eyes is a message
When I was small, God was there
To deliver love every day.
I had forgotten that precious box</description></item><item><title>About Yuming</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/about-yuming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 06:43:46 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/about-yuming/</guid><description>Origin: rohan.dk

I met that nostalgic person in a crowd
The smiling face bites a little
It’s the same as it used to be It’s a hurt love, but there ’s no trace anymore.
If you happen to meet me, you will start crying
I was thinking If you look at the show window sideways
I think of the time when I met Now to the place where different lovers wait</description></item><item><title>Where does the loneliness go - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/where-does-the-loneliness-go-yumi-arai-/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2022 18:19:53 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/where-does-the-loneliness-go-yumi-arai-/</guid><description>ENGLISH
You live in a country at the ends of the earth.
Did you only come back
Because you missed the peaceful winter scenery here?
Did you only call me out of the blue, and tell me we should meet up
To ask what had happened to all your old friends, too? I might act tough, but only I know
You left on a journey then
We embraced each other’s loneliness</description></item><item><title>Message in Rouge - Yumi Arai</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/song-message-in-rouge/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 00:41:53 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/song-message-in-rouge/</guid><description>ルージュの伝言
The song’s lyrics show a girl’s actions after finding out that her boyfriend cheated. What’s surprising is the fact that this girl is off on a journey to tell her boyfriend’s mother about the incident! (Yuming is the only one that can make these lyrics work.)
ENGLISH
I’m on a train by myself right now
To meet his momma
In the corner of my eye as twilight draws near,</description></item><item><title>Lets Comment</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/lets-comment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 09:47:11 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/posts/lets-comment/</guid><description>Hugo ships with support for Disqus, a third-party service that provides comment and community capabilities to websites via JavaScript. But Disqus generates a shit load of page requests and heavy contents&amp;hellip; which even with the benefits that come with having Disqus in place. People just want something that can be used to post a comment, that is.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I choose a Disqus alternative - Utterances. Utterances is a lightweight comments widget built on Github issues.</description></item><item><title>Linh Tinh</title><link>https://eveningcafe.github.io/gallery/linh-tinh/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 23:23:13 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://eveningcafe.github.io/gallery/linh-tinh/</guid><description>Thỉnh thoảng chụp xong cũng không nhớ chụp hôm nào, chụp về chủ đề gì, tại sao lại chụp.
